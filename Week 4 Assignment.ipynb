In this assignment, you will use the cosine distance, which one measure of similarity between vectors, similar to the one discussed in the lectures. You can compute this distance using the graphlab.distances.cosine function. What’s the cosine distance between the articles on ‘Elton John’ and ‘Victoria Beckham’? What’s the cosine distance between the articles on ‘Elton John’ and Paul McCartney’? Which one of the two is closest to Elton John? Does this result make sense to you?
